## TensorFlow

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks implementing Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms in pure TensorFlow to solve different problems. The implementation follows some similar patterns as Keras and other high-level libraries. The key ingredients are: 

- Layers
- Loss
- Metric
- Optimizers 
- Callbacks
- Model

The notebooks use Tensorflow 2.1.
